# viack

Some words which help the interface beween [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) and [vim](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F), which allows lines in [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) like

```shell
$ ack -p -w main -v
```

which searches all python files for the word main, and opens vim with all those files and tellis vim to search for the word main

Also allows lines like

```shell
$ vai sys
```

which searches all python files for any "import sys" or "from sys import", and vims those files with that search
