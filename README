Some words which help the interface beween ack and vim, which allows lines line

$ ack -p -w main -v

which searches all python files for the word main, and opens vim with all those files and telling vim to search for the word main

Also allows 

$ vai sys

which searches all python files for any "import sys" or "from sys import", and vims those files with that search

This code WFM (I use it daily in bash), YMMV
